Welcome to Alfresco Software, Inc.'s intellectual property licensing policy page.  At Alfresco, we have made a decision to participate in the open source movement, and so we want the software development community to understand what we intend to contribute to the community, and how we hope the community will work with us.  This page is intended to help you understand our mission and our intention in working with the community, and the intellectual property policies we have developed to enable our goals.  If you have questions about our policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@alfresco.org" class="inlineLink">info at alfresco dot org</a></span>
<p>
<span class="subHeading">We license our product under LGPL</span><br>
Alfresco has developed a content repository system designed to improve the collaboration, control and compliance of business documents and associated business processes.  Our mission is better meet the needs of our customers by making our software based on open standards, ensuring freedom and peer review by making our source code available.  We want to enable any developer to use the Alfresco repository model to maintain and manage content, whether that developer is an open source developer or a commercial developer.  As Richard Stallman pointed out: <blockquote>&quot;There are reasons that can make it better to use the Library GPL in certain cases. The most common case is when a free library's features are readily available for proprietary software through other alternative libraries. In that case, the library cannot give free software any particular advantage, so it is better to use the Library GPL for that library.&quot;</blockquote> For that reason, we have chosen the LGPL as our license.  The LGPL enables the free software community because it allows developers to re-license our code under the GPL, if they choose to do so.  The LGPL also enables the commercial developers by allowing developers to integrate our software into commercial products, while maintaining dynamically linked portions of those products under commercial licensing terms.
<p> 
<span class="subHeading">We license our product under other licenses upon request.</span><br>
If you are a commercial developer, and would prefer to receive our product under a commercial license agreement, or a different free software license (such as CDDL, CPL, or Mozilla), we are happy to discuss this with you on a case-by-case basis.  Because we have made our software available under LGPL, and we hope that will be acceptable to most commercial developers, we have not posted a standard commercial license on this page.  However, you can request our standard commercial licensing terms for review by contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@alfresco.org" class="inlineLink">info at alfresco dot org</a>.
<p>
If you are not sure whether LGPL is right for you, you can always test our software under the LGPL and inspect the source code before you contact us about purchasing a commercial license.
<p>
<span class="subHeading">Our commercial products include support and services</span><br>
While you may download our software product under LGPL terms free of charge, we also offer commercial products.  At this time, our commercial product is identical to our free software product, but the commercial product includes services such as support, maintenance, professional services, integration, or the like.  To purchase these services, customers enter into agreements with us describing our services and the fees we charge for them.  If you are interested in this, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@alfresco.org" class="inlineLink">info at alfresco dot org</a>.
<p>
<span class="subHeading">We may change our licensing policies.</span><br>
Over time, we may need to streamline our licensing policies to respond to developer needs and to ensure the stability and commercial viability of our products.  Any changes to our policy will be posted on this page.  <!--If you would like to receive any email updates to our policy, you can sign up for our ___________ program here: [____________] -->But of course, if we change our policy, and you have received a license to our code under LGPL, we will not terminate the rights you have already been granted.  Any changes will only apply going forward to new releases of our code.
<p>
<span class="subHeading">We welcome contributions to our source tree.</span><br>
We welcome you to submit fixes, improvements, or other contributions to our code base.  If you release any changes under LGPL, as may be required by that agreement, we would appreciate your letting us know, so we can evaluate whether they would benefit the community as a whole.  Of course, to maintain the integrity of our products, we will need to exercise discretion as to whether contributions you offer are included in our official source tree.
<p>
If you make contributions, and we accept them into our source tree, we want to make sure we have the flexibility to use those contributions under LGPL, other terms we may use in the future, or commercial terms.  Of course, nothing will prevent you from making your contributions available under any open source licensing terms you choose.  We simply ask that you allow us this flexibility, so our intellectual property position does not become too complicated.  As a company, we have made a decision to make our intellectual property available to the community, so we want to make sure our resources are devoted to making our products the best they can be, rather than fighting legal battles over contributions.  Therefore, if you wish to contribute code, we ask that you do so under our standard contribution agreement <a href="" class="inlineLink">[insert link here]</a>, which gives us this flexibility.
<p>
<span class="subHeading">Our trademarks protect us, and the community</span><br>
While the LGPL gives you freedom to change our software, we need to make sure this does not conflict with our responsibility to maintain our trademarks.  Our trademarks are important to us as a company, of course, but also to the consuming public, which will associate our trademarks with the quality and reputation of our business.  We need to strictly enforce our trademark rights to keep them valid, and to protect the public. This portion of our policy describes what you can do with our trademarks, and when you must seek our permission to use them.
<p>
<span class="subHeading">Do not remove or alter our trademarks.</span><br>
If you use or redistribute our binaries, you must not remove our trademarks from them.  When you use our software in the exact form we provide it, we allow - and encourage - you to state that the software is Alfresco software, as long as you include the notices below.   However, if you are distributing unmodified copies over a Web site, please do this by providing a link directly to our site, rather than offering it on your own server.  A downloadable hyperlink is available here to do this: [insert download link here (Source code and executables available for download June 27th 2005)].
<p>   
If you are redistributing unmodified versions of our software, you should use a notice like the following in a prominent place on the packaging and about boxes for your software: &quot;[Your product name] includes the Alfresco Content Repository Software.&quot;
<p>  
All this is necessary to be sure you are using our trademarks correctly to identify us as the source of our software.  However, if you have modified our software, you should instead include a notice (in a prominent place on the packaging and about boxes for your software) stating: &quot;This product includes software used under license from Alfresco Software, Inc.,  but it is not an Alfresco product and has not been tested, endorsed, or approved by Alfresco Software, Inc. or any of its affiliates.&quot;  In this case, you should remove any of our logos from the software.  To make this easier for you, our source downloads - as opposed to our binaries -  do not include our logos.
<p>
In all cases where you use our trademarks - including our name and our logos - you should also follow the guidelines below.
<p>  
Do not use our trademarks in a way that states or suggests that we sponsor, endorse, or are otherwise affiliated with your project or product, without a formal license from us.  We will consider such licenses on a case-by-case basis, but we may not grant you such a license.  No formal license agreement is necessary if you wish to make purely informational reference to our trademarks (such as in a product review), but even informational references should follow our trademark guidelines.  You must also follow these guidelines if you link to www.alfresco.org.  However, you must make it clear that you are not endorsed by or affiliated with us, but are simply linking to our site.  Please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:info@alfresco.org" class="inlineLink">info at alfresco dot org</a> if you have any questions about our trademark policies.
<p>
<span class="subHeading">Trademark Use Guidelines</span>  
The first or most prominent mention of our trademark Alfresco should be accompanied by the letters &quot;TM&quot; in superscript and an asterisk immediately to the right, ALFRESCO&trade;*.  Nearby in typeface large enough to read, you should include an asterisk next to the following: &quot;ALFRESCO&trade; is a trademark of Alfresco Software, Inc., and is used under license.&quot;
<p>
We may register our trademarks in the future, at which time it would be appropriate to replace the &quot;TM&quot; symbol with the registered trademark symbol (&reg;).   We will post a notice here if this happens.
<p>
You do not need to use the TM symbol with every use of our name, only on the first and most prominent reference.  Our trademarks should only be used as adjectives followed by a generic noun - for instance, ALFRESCO&trade; software.  Never vary the spelling and syntax of our trademarks: no abbreviations or acronyms.
