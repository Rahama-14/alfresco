    *            info associated with the store/webapp (if any), then does 
    *            a full rescan to update info.
    * 
    * @param connectTimeout  
    *            Amount of time in milliseconds that this function will wait
    *            before declaring that the connection has failed 
    *            (e.g.: 10000 ms).

    *             'status' may be polled in a separate thread to
