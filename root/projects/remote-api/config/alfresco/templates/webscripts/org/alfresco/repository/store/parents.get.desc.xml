<![CDATA[
Returns the parent folders for the specified non-folder, fileable object<br>
<br>
Inputs:<br>
<br>
ID objectId: ID of a non-folder, fileable object.<br>
(Optional) String filter: filter specifying which properties to return.<br>
(Optional) Boolean includeAllowableActions: False (default)<br>
(Optional) Enum includeRelationships: none (default), source, target, both<br>
<br>
Outputs:<br>
<br>
ResultSet resultSet - Set of folders containing the object.<br>
<br>
Notes:<br>
<br> 
Order is repository-specific<br>
It is suggested that the parent and the ObjectId properties are included in the filter to allow re-ordering if necessary.<br>
If “includeAllowableActions” is TRUE, the repository will return the allowable actions for the current user for each parent folder as part of the output.<br>
"IncludeRelationships" indicates whether relationships are also returned for each returned object. If it is set to "source" or "target", relationships for which the returned object is a source, or respectively a target, will also be returned. If it is set to "both", relationships for which the returned object is either a source or a target will be returned. If it is set to "none", relationships are not returned.<br>
