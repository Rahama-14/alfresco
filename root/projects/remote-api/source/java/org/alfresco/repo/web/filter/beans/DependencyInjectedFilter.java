     * <p>
     * A typical implementation of this method would follow the following pattern:- <br>
     * 1. Examine the request<br>
     * 2. Optionally wrap the request object with a custom implementation to filter content or headers for input
     * filtering <br>
     * 3. Optionally wrap the response object with a custom implementation to filter content or headers for output
     * filtering <br>
     * 4. a) <strong>Either</strong> invoke the next entity in the chain using the FilterChain object (
     * <code>chain.doFilter()</code>), <br>
     * 4. b) <strong>or</strong> not pass on the request/response pair to the next entity in the filter chain to block
     * the request processing<br>
     * 5. Directly set headers on the response after invocation of the next entity in the filter chain.
