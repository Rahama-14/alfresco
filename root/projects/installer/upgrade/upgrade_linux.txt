Alfresco 1.3.0 Upgrade
======================

If you have an existing installation of Alfresco that you wish to upgrade, then you
will need to run a database upgrade script.  The steps for upgrading a MySQL installation
of Alfresco is described below.  Similar steps are needed for other database systems.


Step 1
------

Ensure you have upgraded to Alfresco 1.2.1 before starting the 1.3.0 upgrade.  Then back-up
all data (database and content store) and stop the Alfresco server.


Step 2
------

Run the appropriate upgrade script for your installation.  A sample script is provided for
MySQL and can be executed by running 'db_upgrade_1.2.1_to_1.3.0.sh'.  Make sure your
database is running before executing the script.

The script will prompt you for the MySQL password for Alfresco (originally 'alfresco') and then
run the database script.  The script may take some time to run: it depends on the volume
of data you have.


Step 3
------

Make sure you have made copies of any extensions or customizations to your Alfresco installation.
Typically, these are in the <shared config>/classes/alfresco/extension directory.

Deploy the 1.3.0 WAR file to your application server (e.g. Tomcat or JBoss), replacing the old
'alfresco.war' file.  Then restart the Alfresco server.


Additional Information
----------------------

You can find updated sample extension configurations in the Tomcat or JBoss bundles.
