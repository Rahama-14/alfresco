Other contributors: Welcome!

Note: This translation (2.0.0) is not based od existing translation that was done by Davor Fanton, Mario Šarić, Dinko Srkoč (Helix.hr) for previous Alfresco version (sorry, we didn't know it existed until this one was 99.9% done)
Note (for 2.0.1e):
  Alfresco Enterprise 2.0.1 translation is based on both Alfresco Community 2.0.0 done by Open.hr team and 1.4 translation done by Helix.hr.
  The Helix.hr team tried their best to handpick the best existing translation (choosing between 2.0 (Open.hr) and 1.4 (Helix.hr)) and to review
  translations that exist in 2.0 but not in 1.4 in the spirit of the overall translation effort. However, inconsistencies are possible and help is welcome.
