Installation
============

- Copy all files into <custom config>/messages folder.  From release 1.2, the config folder
  can be in a different location to the web application root.

- Edit the 'web-client-config-custom.xml' file in the <custom config> folder to set what
  languages you wish to be available:

  - Find the '<languages>' section
  - Add or remove languages of the form:

       '<language locale="XX_YY">LangName</language>'

- The order of the language entries determines the order they are presented on the login prompt.
- Save the file.

- Restart the Alfresco server.


====================
Note for translators
====================

If the message contains a variable e.g. {0} then any single quotes must be doubled up as '' to 
escape them correctly.  If the message does not contain a variable then a single quote character
should be used as normal.

We recommend using the Attesoro application for easy editing of translations, as it allows side-by-side editing and automatic encoding of characters, as well as highlighting untranslated entries.  You can download it from: 
  http://attesoro.org/

Simply start it and open the folder where the *_en_US.properties are located.

We also include XLIFF conversions of the properties files that can be used by many translation tools, such as the Open Language Tools (http://open-language-tools.dev.java.net).
