/**
 * This implementation of an AuthenticationComponent can be configured to accept or reject all attempts to login.
 * 
 * This only affects attempts to login using a user name and password.
 * Authentication filters etc. could still support authentication but not via user names and passwords.
 * For example, where they set the current user using the authentication component.
 * Then the current user is set in the security context and asserted to be authenticated.
 * 
 * By default, the implementation rejects all authentication attempts.
