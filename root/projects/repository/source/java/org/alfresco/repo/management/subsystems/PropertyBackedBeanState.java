 * A <code>PropertyBackedBeanState</code> represents the state of a configurable sub-component or subsystem in the
 * Alfresco server. It exposes configurable properties, along with {@link #stop()} and {@link #start()} methods. To
 * modify the state, first ensure its associated component is stopped by calling {@link #stop()}. Then set one or more
 * properties. Then test out the changes with {@link #start()}. In the Alfresco enterprise edition
 * <code>PropertyBackedBeanState</code>s are exposed as persistent MBeans and can be reconfigured at runtime across a
 * cluster via JMX.
