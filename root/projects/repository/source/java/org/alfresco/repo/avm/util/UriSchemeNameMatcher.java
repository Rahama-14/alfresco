/**
 * A NameMatcher that matches an incoming URL against list of schemes
 * (less formally known as "protocols"), case insensitively. 
 * The formal spec for parsing URIs is RFC-3986
 * <p>
 *  Perhaps someday, it might be worthwhile to create a specific
 *  parser for each registered scheme-specific part, and validate
 *  that;  for now, we'll just be be more lax, and assume the URI
 *  is alwasy scheme-qualified.  This matcher will look no further
 *  than the leading colon, and declare "no match" otherwise.
 *  The discussion below explains why.
 * <p>
 * See:  http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986):
 * <pre>
 *  The following regex parses URIs:
 *       ^(([^:/?#]+):)?(//([^/?#]*))?([^?#]*)(\?([^#]*))?(#(.*))?
 *
 *  Given the following URI:   
 *        http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/uri/#Related
 *
 *  The captured subexpressions are:
 *
 *        $1 = http:
 *        $2 = http
 *        $3 = //www.ics.uci.edu
 *        $4 = www.ics.uci.edu
 *        $5 = /pub/ietf/uri/
 *        $6 = <undefined>
 *        $7 = <undefined>
 *        $8 = #Related
 *        $9 = Related   
 *
 *   N0TE:
 *      A URI can be non-scheme qualified because $1 is optional.  Therefore,
 *      the following are all exaples of valid non-scheme qualified URIS:
 *
 *         ""
 *         "moo@cow.com"
 *         "moo@cow.com?wow"
 *         "moo@cow.com?wow#zow"
 *         "moo@cow.com#zow"
 *         "/"
 *         "/moo/cow"
 *         "/moo/cow?wow"
 *         "/moo/cow?wow#zow"
 *         "/moo/cow#zow"
 *         "//moo/cow"
 *         "//moo.com/cow"
 *         "//moo.com/cow/"
 *         "//moo.com/cow?wow"
 *         "//moo.com/cow?wow#zow"
 *         "//moo.com/cow#zow"
 *         "//moo.com:8080/cow"
 *         "//moo.com:/cow"
 *         "//moo.com:8080/cow?wow"
 *         "//moo.com:8080/cow?wow#zow"
 *         "//moo.com:8080/cow#zow"
 *         "///moo/cow"
 *         "///moo/cow?wow"
 *         "///moo/cow?wow#zow"
 *         "///moo/cow#zow"
 *
 *      And so forth...
 *      
 * <pre>
 *
 *  Thus the business end of things as far as scheme matching is: $2,
 *  Most schemes will have a $3 that starts with '//', but not all.
 *  Specificially, the following have no "network path '//' segment,
 *  or aren't required to (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme):
 *  <pre>
 *
 *      cid data dns fax go h323 iax2 mailto mid news pres sip
 *      sips tel urn xmpp about aim callto feed magnet msnim 
 *      psyc skype sms stream xfire ymsgr
 *
 *  </pre>
 *  
 *  Visually the parts are as follows:
 * <pre>
 * 
 *         foo://example.com:10042/over/there?name=ferret#nose
 *         \_/   \_______________/\_________/ \_________/ \__/
 *          |           |            |            |        |
 *       scheme     authority       path        query   fragment
 *          |   _____________________|__
 *         / \ /                        \
 *         urn:example:animal:ferret:nose
 *
 * </pre>
 * 
 * This is useful for classifying URLs for things like whether or not 
 * they're supported by an application.   
 *
 * For example, the LinkValidationService supports http, and https, 
 * is willing to ignore certain well-formed URLs, but treats URLs 
 * will unknown and unsupported protocols as broken.   Concretely,
 * we'd like to avoid treating something like the following one
 * as being non-broken even though you can't apply GET or HEAD
 *  to it.
 *
 * <pre>
 * <a href="mailto:alice@example.com">Email</a>
 * </pre>
 * 
 * As of June 2007,IANA had over 70 registered and provisional protocols
 * listed at http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes.html but sometimes 
 * people create their own too (e.g.: cvs).  Here's the official list:
 * <pre>
 *
 *    aaa aaas acap afs cap cid crid data dav dict dns dtn fax file
 *    ftp go gopher h323 http https iax2 icap im imap info ipp iris
 *    iris.beep iris.lwz iris.xpc iris.xpcs ldap mailserver mailto
 *    mid modem msrp msrps mtqp mupdate news nfs nntp opaquelocktoken
