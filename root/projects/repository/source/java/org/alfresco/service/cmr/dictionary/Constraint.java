/**
 * The interface for classes that implement constraints on property values.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of the actual constraint code should must not synchronize
 * or in any other way block threads.  Concurrent access of the evaluation
 * method is expected, but will always occur after initialization has completed.
 * <p>
 * Attention to performance is <u>crucial</u> for all implementations as
 * instances of this class are heavily used.
 * <p>
 * The constraint implementations can provide standard setter methods that will
 * be populated by bean setter injection.  Once all the available properties have
 * been set, the contraint will be initialized.
