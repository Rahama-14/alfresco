Microsoft Office add-in
=======================

Work in progress.

The C# code only works with Word 2007, as it uses the new Custom Task Pane feature.  A panel that will work with previous version will be created in the future.

The contents of the templates folder need to be added into a space named 'office' in the Presentation Templates space.  The taskpane folder needs to be added into the images folder within the Alfresco webapp, similarly, the taskpane.css needs to go in the ccs folder in the Alfresco webapp.

Until the setup is fully working, you will need to install VSTO 2005 SE to get the add-in installed.
