OFFICE 2003 ADD-IN - Templates
==============================

This folder contains a temporary set of templates needed by the Office 2003 Add-In. They are in the process of being converted to Web Scripts, but in the meantime you can test with these.

NOTE: These templates reference an updated folder and naming structure for images and stylesheet. So if you already have the templates, you'll need to overwrite them.
