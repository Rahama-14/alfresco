Alfresco Add-In for Microsoft Word 2003
=======================================

** INSTALLATION

 1. Extract the entire contents of the zip file, making sure the subfolder structure is maintained.

 2. Run setup.exe
    - Setup will check for the Microsoft .NET 2.0 framework and download it automatically if not found.
    - Setup will also check for and download the Microsoft Visual Studio Tools for Office (VSTO) runtime.

 3. The Add-In will launch automatically the next time Word 2003 is launched.



** CONFIGURATION

 1. If no configuration is found, the Add-In will display the settings screen. You are encouraged to
    fill-in all settings and select "Remember authentication details" for the best experience.

 2. The Add-In will try to help with the correct settings once the Web Client URL is set.

 3. All Office 2003 Add-Ins share the server configuration, so you only need to set the values once.

 4. You can return to the configuration screen later via the link at the bottom of the Add-In panel.
