<p>Swansea Housing Association is a non-profit organization set up in 1978 
which provides homes in the Swansea and Neath Port Talbot areas for a wide 
variety of people of different age groups, many with different needs and 
accommodation preferences. It specializes in creative urban regeneration and 
readily embraces change in social housing procurement and partnering. The 
Association manages a property portfolio with a book value of £130 million and 
an open market value of £450 million.</p>

<h2>Business Challenges</h2>

<p>Swansea Housing Association was looking for a solution that would give them 
a flexible yet secure platform to organize their project content.  They needed 
to be able to set up new project templates quickly and easily without incurring 
costly consulting man hours and unnecessary project delays.</p>

<p>The system needed to be able to give users the ability to create and 
participate in an auditable document lifecycle where access can be given to 
those that need it in a secure fashion even from a remote location. Previously, 
workflow and business process modifications required changes to the underlying 
programming code, which were costly and time consuming.</p>

<p>They were looking for a system that would be able to adapt to the 
Association&rsquo;s developing ECM requirements by creating an open and 
scalable repository to build custom solutions in support of their expanding 
property portfolio. An open architecture would give them the flexibility to 
add-on systems in the future in a modular way at a lower cost.</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;We could clearly see the benefits of Alfresco over our 
existing system. We now have the ability to manage our process and workflows in 
ways we could only do after placing a call to our developers&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="quote_author">Geoff Pettifor &ndash; Director of Development, Swansea 
Housing Association</p>

<h2>Creating Secure Document Management</h2>

<p>It was very important for the new document management system to deliver a 
solution that the Association&rsquo;s own users could share and manage 
themselves. Alfresco with its intuitive, easy to set up rules, business 
processes and workflows can be modified as and when required by its end users. 
Previously to clone the application required several days of work while now a 
new project can be set up using same rules and space structure in a matter of 
minutes.</p>

<p>Swansea Housing Association also required integrated transformation of 
Microsoft&reg; Word&trade; documents to PDF to eliminate manual creation by the 
Association staff which Alfresco could deliver in one proven, flexible 
solution. The new system also needed to be able to migrate data to Alfresco.</p>

<p>With the help of Alfresco business partners Aarden Ringcroft and Rivet Logic 
Corp. This was easily achieved by extracting data to an XML 
format which conformed to Alfresco .acp file import type and moving the data 
over using the standard Alfresco administrator console import. Document 
versions, user and group information was brought over simultaneously leveraging 
the power and ease of use of the Alfresco Web Services.</p>

<p>By simplifying and modularizing content management, the Alfresco system is 
much faster than many commercial content management systems. In addition it 
provides a unified open and scalable repository upon which to build custom 
solutions in support of Swansea Housing Associations ever-evolving ECM 
requirements.</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;This represents a major opportunity to change and enhance the way we 
work.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="quote_author">Geoff Pettifor &ndash; Director of Development, Swansea 
Housing Association</p>

<h2>The Benefits of Using Alfresco</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fast set-up and modification of business processes and workflows</li>
<li>Integrated transformation of word document to .pdf eliminating manual creation by Swansea staff</li>
<li>Greater flexibility and speed in setting up additional projects utilizing space templates</li>
<li>Provides a unified open and scalable repository upon which to build custom solutions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Swansea Housing Association Chose Alfresco</h2>

<p>Swansea Housing Association chose Alfresco for the experience of their 
team &ndash; 15 years of experience in document management &ndash; together 
with the support of Alfresco business partners Aarden Ringcroft and Rivet Logic 
Corp. The Association also realized that through the use of open technology the 
Alfresco solution is significantly lower in cost than other ECM solutions on 
the market. This open source approach delivers a solution that is easy to use, 
scalable and flexible, giving them the ability to easily integrate other 
products or partners as they need to build on their ECM project for the 
future.</p>
