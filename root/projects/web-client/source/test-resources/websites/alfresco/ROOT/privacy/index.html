By using our web site, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information by Alfresco as explained below. </p>
      <h2>1. Personal Information.</h2>
      <p> You have complete control over your personal information. In general, you can visit our web site without providing us with any personal information. However, there are instances where we must have your personal information in order for us to grant you an access to our protected and secured sites. This information may include registration data (your name, address, email address, phone number, title, etc.), information request data and response data ("User Information"). When you receive your confirmation email or when you receive any email from the list server, you will be given instructions on how to remove yourself from the list... </p>
      <h2>2. Use of User Information.</h2>
      <p> We intend to use such information for purposes of supporting your and your employer's relationship with Alfresco by designing a web site content that is suitable to your needs and alerting you to new product and service offerings as they become available. This User Information may be retained by Alfresco to verify compliance with the agreement between Alfresco and your employer, to keep track of the domains from which people visit us, to create a user profile to better serve you and your employer, or to simply contact you either electronically or otherwise. If you decide that we should not use your personal User Information to contact you, please let us know and we will not use that information for such purpose. However, please do not submit any User Information if you are less than 18 years of age... </p>
      <h2>3. Disclosure of User Information.</h2>
      <p> Alfresco does not sell, trade or transfer User Information to third parties. However, we may share User Information with our business partners for marketing, advertising or product/service offering purposes. For example, we provide User Information to our service providers for direct emailing of our newsletters, online surveys or notifications on Alfresco Offerings to our viewers. We also disclose User Information if: we have your consent; we need to share it in order to provide you with the products and/or services you requested; we respond to a court order or you violate our Terms of Use. You may separately agree to provide your personal information to third parties that provide content for Alfresco Offerings, in order to access and/or use their products and/or services. If you agree to provide such information to these third parties, then your personal information will be subject to their privacy policies... </p>
      <h2>4. Accuracy and Security.</h2>
      <p> The accuracy and security of the User Information is important to Alfresco. Currently, you may review and request updates to your User Information retained by Alfresco. If you contact us to correct your User Information, we will attempt to correct such inaccuracies in a timely manner. Alfresco is concerned with the security of your User Information and is committed to taking reasonable steps to protect it from unauthorized access and use of that personal information. To that end, we put in place the appropriate physical, electronic and managerial policies and procedures to secure your personal User Information.

If you prefer not to accept a cookie, you can set your web browser (Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator) to warn you before accepting cookies or you can refuse all cookies by turning them off in your web browser.
