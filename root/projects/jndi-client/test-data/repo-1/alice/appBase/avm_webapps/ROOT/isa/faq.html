<p class="question"><a href="Javascript:expandNav('tcm:19-12395')">What are ISAs all about?</a></p>

<div class="hidden" id="tcm:19-12395">
<p>ISA stands for Individual Savings Account.</p><p>Basically they're the government's way of encouraging you to save by giving you a tax incentive. Unlike bank or building society deposit accounts, unit trusts or similar investments, you don't have to tell the taxman about your ISA because there's no additional income tax or capital gains tax to pay.</p><p>You can use your ISA to invest in stocks and shares or simply as a risk free savings account where your interest comes tax free, or a bit of both.</p><p>ISAs give both novices and experts an easy way to invest in the stock market.</p>

</div><p class="question"><a href="Javascript:expandNav('tcm:19-12396')">Are ISAs right for me?</a></p>

<div class="hidden" id="tcm:19-12396">
<p>Not if you like paying unnecessary tax on your savings.</p><p>But if you're a taxpayer thinking about savings and investments, the answer's yes.</p><p>At the very least a cash ISA will give you a better return than you'll get from your bank or building society savings account, because your interest comes tax free.</p><p>If you're thinking of investing money in stocks and shares through an ISA, we recommend you only invest money you can afford to tuck away for at least 5 years, to increase your chances of a good return. But remember, most stock market investments are considered medium to high risk and there is no guarantee you'll get back the full amount you invest. If you couldn't stand the thought that your savings might go down as well as up in value, the stock market probably isn't right for you.</p>

</div><p class="question"><a href="Javascript:expandNav('tcm:19-12397')">Do I need a big lump sum to invest?</a></p>

<div class="hidden" id="tcm:19-12397">
<p>Nope. With a Virgin ISA you can invest from as little as £1.</p><p>In fact, saving monthly in our Bonds and Gilts ISA would have given you a better return than saving up a lump sum in a high street savings account to invest in your ISA later.</p><p>If you'd saved £100 a month in our bond and gilt fund over the last 5 years (offering higher returns than a deposit account, without a big increase in risk) it would now be worth £6,497.38.</p><p>Remember, past performance is not a guide to the future and a deposit account is a risk-free investment. Your capital is at risk in stock market type investments, and you should only invest for the long term.</p><p class="text-small">Source: Standard and Poor's Micropal - www.micropal.com. Virgin Income Trust (bonds and gilts), regular savings of £100 on the first of each month from 1.6.01 to 1.6.06, buying to selling unit prices, basic rate tax with income reinvested. High street savings comparison is based on a basic rate taxpayer saving £100 a month from 1.6.01 to 1.6.06. 'High street savings account' is the UK Savings rate 2500+, based on the average rate paid by the top 20 building societies. The total value of the average high street savings account would be £6,208.49.</p>

</div><p class="question"><a href="Javascript:expandNav('tcm:19-12398')">So how much should I invest and when?</a></p>

<div class="hidden" id="tcm:19-12398">
<p>If you've got a lump sum to invest, the golden rule is to invest it as soon as you can. If you haven't, you can save monthly.</p><p>Unless you've got a particular target in mind, simply save what you're comfortable with.</p><p>One of the biggest ironies of stock market investment is that when share prices are at their highest after many years of growth, this often attracts investors in greater numbers, even though you actually get fewer shares for your money. Yet when share prices have dropped, many investors avoid the stock market even though lower share prices would mean they'd get more for their money. At Virgin Money, we always stress that:</p><ul><li>It's not when you invest that's important, but how long you invest for.</li><li>Waiting around until the market's right can mean waiting forever.</li><li>If you do happen to invest when share prices are low, think of it as a bonus.</li></ul><p>But remember, as share prices can go up and down, it's a good idea only to invest money you can afford to see dip in value.</p>

</div><p class="question"><a href="Javascript:expandNav('tcm:19-12399')">How long do I need to invest for?</a></p>

<div class="hidden" id="tcm:19-12399">
<p>Stocks and shares should be seen as long term investments, so we suggest keeping your money tucked away for at least five years, preferably longer, to increase your chances of a good return.</p><p>You can, however, get at your money any time you need to.</p>

</div><p class="question"><a href="Javascript:expandNav('tcm:19-12400')">Am I tied to rigid payments?</a></p>

<div class="hidden" id="tcm:19-12400">
<p>On the contrary. You can stop, start, or change your payments any time you like. And you can get at your money whenever you need to. All without penalty.</p>

<div class="hidden" id="tcm:19-12407">
<p>It's not really a suitable place for your 'rainy day money' - cash you might need to take out again soon. Share prices do go up and down on a daily basis, and there's no guarantee you'll get back the full amount you invest. Also, occasional longer periods of stock market decline (known as 'bear markets') can even mean you have to wait a few years to see a decent return on your money.</p><p>But if you can afford to tuck money away for five years or more, that's when the stock market usually comes into its own. Over that sort of timespan few investments would normally give you a better return. The graph below shows how, despite the ups and downs, the overall trend has always been one of steady upward growth, making it the No.1 place for professional investors.</p><p><img alt="Graph showing the 20yr performance of the stockmarket" height="274" width="380" tcmuri="tcm:19-12748" src="/Images/20yearGraph_tcm19-12748.gif"></p><p>If you're not comfortable investing in stock market shares then our bond and gilt ISA might be a better bet. It should give you a higher return than a building society savings account, without significantly increasing your risk.</p><p>Remember, a deposit account is a risk-free investment. Your capital is at risk in stock market type investments, and you should only invest for the long term.</p><p class="text-small">Source: Standard &amp; Poor's Micropal, www.micropal.com, All-Share Index, basic rate tax payer, income reinvested, 682% growth from 1.2.86 to 02.01.06.</p>

</div><p class="question"><a href="Javascript:expandNav('tcm:19-12408')">What about the risks of investing in shares?</a></p>

<div class="hidden" id="tcm:19-12408">
<p>Investing in stock market shares is not without its risks. They can rise spectacularly in value over many years, go into periods of decline, or fall suddenly in value, with no guarantee you'll get back the full amount you invest. The key thing to remember is, the longer you stay invested in the stock market the better you tend to do.</p><p>If you only invest in a handful of shares over the short term you'll certainly increase your risk. But by investing over many years and spreading your savings over a wide range of shares, you lessen that risk and actually increase your chances of getting a good return.</p><p>The risks of not investing in the stock market are rarely spelled out, but are just as real. For instance, you probably think your bank or building society savings are safe, but did you know their real value can actually fall over time. It's to do with inflation. If your deposit account only earns 2% in interest but the cost of living goes up 2.5%, your savings aren't growing in real terms, they're shrinking. Now that is scary. Remember though, investing in an ISA is different to a deposit account, where your money is not at risk.</p>

</div><p class="question"><a href="Javascript:expandNav('tcm:19-12409')">If the stock market falls do I lose my money?</a></p>

<div class="hidden" id="tcm:19-12409">
<p>History shows that long-term investors shouldn't be too worried when the stock market falls. The people who lose out are those who panic and cash in their investment, instead of waiting for the market to rise again. For example, in 1987 the market actually finished higher than it started, despite falling 32% in the October 87 'crash'.</p><p>However, if the market goes into a longer fall (known as a 'bear market') it can sometimes be a few years before you start to see a decent return on your money. As ever, time is the key, and you should only consider investing money you can afford to tuck away for at least five years.</p>

</div><p class="question"><a href="Javascript:expandNav('tcm:19-12410')">How do trackers compare to active funds when the going gets tough?</a></p>

<div class="hidden" id="tcm:19-12410">
<p>It's a myth that active fund managers come into their own when the stock market goes through a rocky patch. No fund manager has a hotline to stocks which don't go down when markets fall. Most get the timing wrong, locking in your losses by selling investments that have already fallen, or buying after the market's begun climbing again. With a tracker you never have to worry on either score.</p><p>With an index tracker you know it will go down when the market does, and come up again when the market does. But it's the historic long-term upward growth of the market you're looking to tap into, rather than gambling on making a quick profit out of short-term ups and downs.</p>

</div><p class="question"><a href="Javascript:expandNav('tcm:19-12411')">Are all index tracking ISAs the same?</a></p>

<div class="hidden" id="tcm:19-12411">
<p>No, some have a bias toward certain sectors of the market. They may only invest in the top 100 companies, or in technology stocks or small companies. These investments can pay off, but if an individual sector performs badly it can have a more serious impact on your returns than if you'd invested across the market as a whole. The fact is, investments which track the FT-SE All-Share Index consistenly outperform the vast majority of UK unit trusts.</p>

</div><p class="question"><a href="Javascript:expandNav('tcm:19-12412')">Do tracker funds with the lowest charges give the best returns?</a></p>

<div class="hidden" id="tcm:19-12412">
<p>Not necessarily. How closely a fund tracks its chosen stock market index (known as 'tracking error') can also have an impact on your returns. Some trackers don't invest in all the shares on an index. Instead they select a 'sample' of shares to invest in, which is really active management by the back door, and will affect your returns. A 'fully replicated' tracker which buys shares in every company on the index will track the index closer.</p><p>Also, always check charges carefully. Some companies advertise what appears to be the lowest charging tracker, but there are often strings attached, or other charges that can bump up the cost.</p>
