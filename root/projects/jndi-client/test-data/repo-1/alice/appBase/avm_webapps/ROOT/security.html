<p class="text-bold">Latest security information</p><p class="txtnormal">You may have heard in the news recently about an e-mail scam tricking customers into going into a bogus website and disclosing confidential details about their bank and credit card accounts.</p><p class="txtnormal">We'd just like to confirm that Virgin Money never send out e-mails to customers asking you to disclose confidential information online. If you get such an e-mail, don't respond to it, or click on any links in it. Please forward it immediately to&nbsp;<a class="txtlinkunderline" href="mailto:info@virginmoney.com"><span class="txtbold">info@virginmoney.com</span></a> and we'll investigate. And if you're concerned about the validity of any e-mails you get from Virgin Money, call our support team on&nbsp;<span class="txtbold">08456 10 20 30</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Security and privacy</strong></p><p>At Virgin Money we pull out all the stops to keep the information you give us safe and sound. We follow strict security procedures on how your personal information is stored and used, and who sees it, to help stop any unauthorised person getting hold of it.</p><p>To make sure you can securely access any accounts you hold with us, we ask you to set up your own security details (things like a username and password). We know they can be a pain, but they’re there to protect you.</p><p><strong>Personal information we need from you<br></strong>For starters we usually need your name and address, and anything else that helps us to identify you. We’ll only ever ask for essential information that helps us give you the best service we can.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How we collect the personal information and why</strong><br>
We can collect this online or when you contact us by post or phone. For example when you ask us about a product or enter a competition.&nbsp;</p><p>We might use this information for other marketing promotions and to let you know about our products and services, but only if you’re happy for us to do so. We might also use your personal data for statistical analysis of our customer base.</p><p>We don’t collect or hold onto your personal information unless it’s absolutely necessary and we don’t keep it for any longer than we need or are required to by law.</p><p><strong>Is your personal information shared with anybody else?<br></strong>We’ll only pass your personal information to other companies, Virgin or otherwise, with your approval when you register with us - except as required by law. This could be for credit checking purposes or simply companies with other products or services we think might be up your street, who may then get in touch with you.</p><p>If you’d like a list of other companies that personal data could be transferred to, just ask.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We may also send you details of products, services and promotions from other companies that might appeal to you. But again, if you’d rather we didn’t, just tell us.&nbsp;</p><p>We don’t rent or sell our customer lists to anyone. We just use them to sort customer information and research our customers’ needs and preferences.</p><p>Our website contains links to other websites, which may well have different privacy and security policies to us. Please remember we don’t have any control over these websites, so we can’t take responsibility for any information you give them.</p><p><strong>Access to personal information</strong><br>
You have full access to all information stored about you.&nbsp; You can ask us at any time to give you details about what it’s being used for and who else might see it. But you may have to pay a small administration fee. Also, please ask if you’d like us to change or delete any personal information you’ve previously given us. If we can we will, but sometimes we have to keep your records for legal reasons.</p><p><strong>Cookies<br></strong>These are small files placed on your computer's hard drive, or in your browser memory, when you visit our website. It helps us speed things up for you when you come back. It tells us what parts of the site you visit, what you like and what's most relevant to you. What cookies don't do is store any personal or confidential information about you.</p><p><strong>Transfer of your personal data outside the EU<br></strong>Countries outside the European Union may have a lower standard of protection for personal information than that required by the Data Protection Act 1998. If we need to transfer your data to a company based outside the EU, we’ll try to make sure your personal data is handled in line with UK law.&nbsp;</p><p>If you apply for a Virgin Personal Loan or the Virgin Credit Card, we’ll need to send your data to our partner company MBNA in the USA.</p><p><strong>Security<br></strong>We use some of the most cutting-edge online security measures known to man. All details passing between us are scrambled using 128-bit encryption.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Handy security tips<br></strong>Just to be on the safe side try these little nuggets:&nbsp;</p><ul class="reddotlist"><li>Keep any passwords and user names secret. And don't write them down in any way someone else might understand. Make them impossible to guess and change them now and again.&nbsp;</li><li>Use anti-virus software and remember to keep it up to date. Popular anti-virus products include: McAfee, Norton (from Symantec) and Sophos.&nbsp;</li><li>Protect yourself further against viruses by keeping your operating system (e.g. Windows XP) and web browser (e.g. Internet Explorer) up to date. You should be able to do this at the website of the company which produces your operating system (e.g. Microsoft).&nbsp;</li><li>Use personal firewall software to prevent unauthorised access to your PC from the internet. Popular personal firewall products include: McAfee, Symantec, and Zone Alarm.&nbsp;</li><li>If you share a computer, remember to clear the cache after use (The ‘help’ will normally show you how to do this, if you’re not sure).</li><li>Don't open e-mail attachments from strangers, and be wary of any unexpected e-mails containing attachments, especially those with file endings .exe, .pif or .vbs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br>
We take security extremely seriously but as no system is 100% secure, we can’t completely guarantee the protection of your personal information, any more than any other organisation can. So we can’t accept any liability for the loss, theft or misuse of your personal details when they’re processed on this website or the internet generally.</p><p><strong>Future changes to our privacy policy<br></strong>Any changes we make to our policy will be put on our website and the Virgin.com website. Please check it out from time to time, so you’re always fully aware of what information is collected, how it’s used and under what circumstances it may be passed on.</p><p><strong>Contact details</strong><br>
