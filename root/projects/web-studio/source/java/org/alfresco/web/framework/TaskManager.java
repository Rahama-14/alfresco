/**
 * Basic implementation of a task manager for use in asynchronous 
 * processing and monitoring of tasks.
 * 
 * Tasks are added to the task manager.  When added, they are 
 * assigned a reference id so that subsequent calls to the task
 * manager can check on the task status.
 * 
 * A task starter thread wakes up occasionally and checks whether 
 * there are any tasks waiting to be processed.
 * 
 * If a task is found, it is attached to a task worker thread and 
 * then executed.  When the task worker thread completes, it is 
 * handed back to the task worker thread pool.
