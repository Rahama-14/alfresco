Alfresco FIXES:

----------------------------------------

FIX1: FLASH MOVIES MUST BE TRANSPARENT

Description:

There is no way to pass in param "wmode" as "transparent" to the FlashAdapter class in YUI.
This must be done since flash will otherwise always be on top of the z-index stack.
That would make popups only be partly displayed if a flashmovie was in the way.

Affected files:

uploader-exprimental.js
uploader-exprimental-min.js
uploader-exprimental-debug.js

---------------------------------------

FIX2: FILES WITH 0B IN SIZE

Description:

If a file (or one of several files) is selected that has 0b in size, an error is thrown.
YUI did not catch this so therefore NO files was communicated to the javascript.
Now its catche and all files including the one with 0b in size will be sent to javascript.
Since this file cant be uploaded the javascript should inform the user about this.

Affected files:

Uploader.as - NOTE! Look in web/yui/swfplayer/assets/as/Uploader.as for the new source code.
