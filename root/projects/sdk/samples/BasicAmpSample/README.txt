================================

This project is a small SDK sample that shows how classes and configuration files
can be arranged to generate an Alfresco Module Package (AMP).  For more details on
the supported layout of files, see:
   http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Module_Management_Tool

Use ANT to generate the AMP file from the build script:
   ant -f build.xml
