<b>Coming soon!</b>
<br/><br/>
<p>
The Alfresco <b>Plugin and Add-on Library</b> will appear here in the near future.  This will allow you to browse all kinds of interesting extensions, including <a href="http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Surf_Platform" target="_blank">Alfresco Surf</a> web components, pages, templates, themes and gadgets.  This will also allow you to quickly discover and locate Alfresco Module Packages and other types of updates for the Alfresco Repository tier as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Our goal is to provide a very easy way for Alfresco users to collaborate and share the things that they build.  For that reason, this portion of the web site is being built using <a href="http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Alfresco_Labs_3" target="_blank">Alfresco 3.0</a> and its rich set of social computing features.  People will be able to collaborate on add-ons, comment on them, rate them, receive notifications on updates or improvements and finally subscribe to interesting site and tag feeds.
<br/>
